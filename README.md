# Bayesian-Network-use-to-estimate-Average-Probability-of-Failure-on-Demand-on-safety-systems

Manufacturing facilities and their components are particularly subjected to accidental events that can affect workers,population, as well as assets, environment, and last but not least, production quality and yield. In order to decrese the possibility of this events to occur, engineers and safety professionals design safety systems that avoid or mitigate this incidents. But, how to be sure that this protection systems not going to fail when we need it? That's why knowing the probability of failure on demand (PFD) for protection systems is important for industry, because it is telling us that if something goes wrong, we have a protection system ready to act.
 

For this study, we're going to use bayesian networks (a probabilistic graphical models) in order to estimate if this safety systems have the mininum availability required to operate safe, and how probability of an undesirable event can decrease if avaliability of protection system is adequate enough.
